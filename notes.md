## Getting started

Practice some good programming style. Here are some of the tips for writing clean and readable MATLAB code for your group assignment:

1. _Use descriptive names:_
   - Assign meaningful names to variables and functions, e.g., `Height` instead of `h`.
   - For multi-word names, use capitalization or underscores for readability, e.g., `CarSpeed` or `car_speed`.

2. _Break long code into smaller pieces:_
   - Divide long code into smaller, single-function pieces using user-defined functions and code cells (`%%`).
   - User-defined functions are created with the `function` keyword. Each code cell can be run individually.

3. _Comment your code:_
   - Use the single percentage sign `%` to add comments explaining the purpose of commands, variables, and functions.
   - Comments aid both your future self and others in understanding your code.

4. Don’t write dense code. Allow empty lines between the commands to enhance code readability.

5. Use consistent indentation. For example, proper indentation improves the readability of code with multiple cycles of `for ... end` loops.
  
6. Don’t make your lines too long. Split long commands and computations using triple dots ...

Remember, readability is crucial, as it makes understanding, maintaining, and debugging the code easier for everyone.
